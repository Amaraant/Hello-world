# Hello-world

Hello!

My name is Tanya.
I'm an English-Russian translator who is curious about web-design and programming.
Although my knowledge of computer languages is not yet appropriate, I hope to improve with the help of Coursera and Github.
I have signed up to Github during my "HTML, CSS, and Javascript for Web Developers" Coursera course.

I hope you have fun and wish you good luck here, too!

Sincerely, Tanya.
